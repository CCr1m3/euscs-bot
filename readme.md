# todo

- ~~Better interfacing between slashcommands -> handlers -> db (now its a bit messy)~~
- ~~/cancel instead of /result 0 0   (in case someone is not here)~~
- /result reserved to people in the match only (probably reserved to loosing team too)
- /result integer checking for winning state ( score between teams >=2)
- better matchmaking algorithms (now it takes 6 players randomly in the pool, and is often first come first serve since it's matching every 15 secs)
- /autojoin (rejoin queue after match if match was not canceled)
- Pinned message on dedicated channel with howto use bot
- ~~rating update (elo based)~~
- rating based matchmaking
