# todo

~~- Pinned message on dedicated channel with howto use bot~~
- #request channel for bot talk and commands
- Automatically leave queue after a time (1h?). Probably tag the person who was forced out. Add queue time into match quality calculations. 
~~- Currency system. Get currency from winning (more, 20?), losing (less, 10?) and predicting correctly (5?). Pay with currency for @ Ai.Mi (20). (/currency)~~
~~- Match predictions. Disallow people playing in a match from predicting.~~
- Punish dodging people in some way (reduce match priority by reducing quality of matches with dodging players?)
- /autojoin (rejoin queue after match if match was not canceled)
- rematch ?
- /swap
- ~~update bot permission link in this file~~
- ~~/result reserved to people in the match only (probably reserved to loosing team too)~~
- ~~/result integer checking for winning state ( score between teams >=2)~~
- ~~better matchmaking algorithms (now it takes 6 players randomly in the pool, and is often first come first serve since it's matching every 15 secs)~~
- ~~rating update (elo based)~~
- ~~rating based matchmaking~~
- ~~Better interfacing between slashcommands -> handlers -> db (now its a bit messy)~~
- ~~/cancel instead of /result 0 0   (in case someone is not here)~~
